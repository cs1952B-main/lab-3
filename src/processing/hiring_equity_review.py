TODO: 

    FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENT:
    REQ-E: HireSense should measure outcomes based on the profile data of Applicants to jobs at a Company with the goal of assisting the 
           Company in ensuring equitable outcomes. In essence, HireSense should look at the outcomes of different kinds of Applicants, analyze
           these outcomes, and see if there are relationships between certain characteristics of Applicants and their outcomes. It will use its
           findings to ensure equitable outcomes as defined below:
           
           TODO: Define 'equity' for the purposes of this requirement. You should come up with your own specific standard of equity
           that your implementation abides by and aims for.

           Equity: ... <YOUR DEFINITION HERE> ...

    STEP 4-C: 
    For this task, you will need to choose how to process and represent data that HireSense ordinarily collects to assist 
    Applicants and Employers in finding a good fit to instead analyze and attempt to better and promote equitable hiring practices
    within Companies. 
    
    You will need to decide what kind of characteristics to include to try to measure equity, how to report this to a
    Company in a way that will be work toward the goal of equitable outcomes, and how much detail you should give a Company
    about potentially sensitive Applicant information. Be sure to center your definition of equity in your chosen implementation

    In some ways, this is a simpler data processing task that 5B, the complexity is in the choices about what characteristics to use to 
    measure equitable outcomes and how much information to give a Company to ensure the information actually betters hiring practices while
    balancing the fact that this information may contain identifying or sensitive user data.
