TODO: 

    FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENT:
    REQ-E: HireSense should measure outcomes based on the profile data of Applicants to jobs at a Company with the goal of assisting the 
           Company in ensuring equitable outcomes. In essence, HireSense should look at the outcomes of different kinds of Applicants, analyze
           these outcomes and see if there are relationships between certain characteristics of Applicants and their outcomes. It will use its
           findings to ensure equitable outcomes as defined below:
           
           TODO: this can be changed later of course, just an example based on Prof. Netter's comment
           In it's mission statement, HireSense defines equity as "equality of opportunity" meaning all Applicants should have an equal opportunity
           to find a job, apply to a job, advance in the interview process, and get the job.

    STEP-5C: 
    For this task, you will need to choose how to process and represent data that is ordinarily collected and used to assist in hiring to then 
    analyze and attempt to better hiring practices. You will need to decide what kind of characteristics should they include to try to 
    provide equal opportunity across, how to report this to a Company in a way that will be work toward the goal of equitable outcomes, and
    how much detail you should give a Company about potentially sensitive Applicant information.

    In some ways, this is a simpler data processing task that 5B, the complexity is in the choices about what characteristics to use to 
    measure equitable outcomes and how much information to give a Company to ensure the information actually betters hiring practices while
    not handing over identifying or sensitive user data.

    TODO:
    This could incorporate user feedback about the hiring process, if we wanted to do this we'd like to have that as an option for students
    we could provide a class they could fill in OR provide the class for them to cutdown on the ways to go off the deep end (like having way
    too much info asked for in the form)

    Next Steps:
    - need to decide whether they want to apply a specific standard of what equity means
        - for gender could mean we need to hire 50% women OR
        - hiring practice should be no less (or better!) than the percentage of women in the applicant pool
    - maybe the platform doesn't make a judgment and communicate it to the Company but just hands over the data and lets
      them apply their own standard
