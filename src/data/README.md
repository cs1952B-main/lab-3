## Notes for further dev

1) I think providing students with a doc (probably in place of this dev readme) which outlines all the data classes, fields for those classes, and the ones that we want them to fill in themselves in here would be good.

2) On that note, I've filled them all in for now, but we can discuss where it might make sense to remove some for students to
fill in!
