# Reflections:
## Please put your Step 5 reflections in here!

### Simple Search:
We asked you to choose between equipping HireSense with full text search or keyword search functionality. Please reflect on your decisions by answering the following:
1. Which factors did you take into account when making this choice? Which of them weighed most heavily in your assessment and why?  
2. When does your choice of search functionality fall short? Name at least one situation for each direction of search (applicants searching positions and positions searching applicants). 

### Recommendation:
We asked you to make implementation decisions which generate new data regarding user preferences and recommendations that are being stored. As you have seen in Lab 2, data, once collected, is vulnerable to being used beyond the original purpose. How and for which other purposes the data might be used is something to consider when making decisions about features that collect it in the first place. Please reflect on your decisions by answering the following:
1. What else could the information you choose to collect now potentially be used for in the future? For example, what doors might it open if Positions had access to Applicant’s user interaction data (as seen in helper_classes.py)?
2. HireSense strives to make recommendations which are both useful and equitable. Which of your implementation choices best reflect these goals? In which ways does your implementation fall short of them?

### Hiring Equity Review:
We asked you to provide a definition of equity, then implement a hiring equity review to assess companies according to that definition. Please reflect on your decisions by answering the following:
1. Explain the interpretation of equity you draw on in your implementation of the hiring equity review. Which variables did you choose to use in your assessment and why are they (and not others) the most relevant for your definition of equity?
2. Is handing the outcomes and report of this hiring equity review over to Company’s privately (as HireSense does now) the right approach? Should this information instead be publicly available or turned over to Applicants? Why or why not?

### Broader Context:
1. How, if at all, does this kind of recommendation system (and specifically your implementation) contribute to improving justice in the hiring process? Are there other approaches which would be more effective for achieving that goal?
